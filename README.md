# ECEN676-Project-Path confidence based Prefetching

I led the design and implementation of this project as part of the ECEN676: Advanced Computer Architecture course, guiding a team focused on exploring memory prefetching strategies for modern processors. Our work centered on enhancing the Signature Path Prefetcher (SPP) by introducing a confidence-based adaptive throttling mechanism, implemented as SPP_ALT.

I coordinated the overall system design, integration, simulation, and performance analysis using ChampSim, ensuring that our implementation was benchmarked rigorously against leading prefetchers such as BOP, VLDP, and DA-AMPM. The project emphasized both architectural innovation and quantitative evaluation — aligning closely with real-world hardware design practices for CPU and AI accelerators.

This repository contains our implementation and performance analysis of SPP_ALT(our implementation) vs SPP_DEV(Original implementation), No Prefetcher, Variable Length Delta Prefetcher, Best Offset Prefetcher, DA-AMPM Prefetcher using the ChampSim simulator as part of the ECEN676 course project.

The primary goals are:
- To implement and enhance the Signature Path Prefetcher (SPP)
- To evaluate how each prefetcher performs across diverse benchmarks
- To compare and analyse the SPP results with present best prefetchers (BOP, VLDP, DA-AMPM)

##  Prefetchers Implemented and Compared

The following prefetchers have been implemented and integrated into ChampSim for simulation:

- **Best Off-set Prefetcher(BOP):** It evaluates several offsets during execution and select the one most likely to be useful for prefetching. Hence, it automatically adapts to varying memory access patterns. However, it doesn’t consider temporal ordering between delta patterns, and suffer from low accuracy on complex, yet predictable patterns.
- **Variable length Delta Prefetcher(VLDP):** It builds up delta histories between successive cache line misses within physical pages, then uses these histories to predict the order of cache line misses in new pages. It uses multiple prediction tables, each of which stores predictions based on different length of input history.
- **Signature Path Prefetcher (SPP):** It uses an optimized history based scheme that predicts complex address patterns precisely. Unlike many history based algorithms, tracks complex address patterns across page boundaries and continues prefetching immediately as they move to new pages. Finally, it adjusts its prefetching, for each stream based on confidence it has in its predictions, enabling adaptive throttling.
- We have implemented the Signature Path Prefetcher as mentioned in "Path Confidence based Lookahead Prefetching" research paper by enhancing GHR.

##  Simulator: ChampSim

[ChampSim](https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim) is a trace-based simulator used for evaluating memory hierarchy designs. It supports user-defined prefetchers and allows repeatable, deterministic experiments using compressed memory access traces.

## Benchmarks

We have used 20 SPEC2017 Benchmarks:

- `620.omnetpp_s-874B.txt`
- `621.wrf_s-575B.txt`
- `623.xalancbmk_s-700B.txt`

- `649.fotonik3d_s-1176B.txt`
- `654.roms_s-842B.txt`
- `657.xz_s-3167B_1.txt`

These benchmarks are chosen to span a range of CPU and memory intensities, helping to expose strengths and weaknesses of each prefetcher.

## Analysis Approach

For each benchmark, we have collected simulation results and used following metrics for comparison:


- **IPC (Instructions Per Cycle)**
- **MPKI (Misses per kilo instructions)**
- **Accuracy**
- **With and Without GHR**
- **The number of useful and useless prefetches**
